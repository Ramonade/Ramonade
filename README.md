- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ramon. I major in Medicine, but I'm interested in programming. 
- I find that people in computer science field are somehow more innovative than people around me in the medicine field. To me, learning programming is a kind of relaxation which enables me to get out of the rigid life as a medical student.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript.
